# Linked List

Before starting this project, I set it up using my custom template repo. My goal was to enable future expansion, such as creating a UI/UX for displaying the list and nodes directly in the browser instead of only in the console. This way, users can visually interact with and understand the relationships between nodes and see the entire list structure.

You can find the project code inside [/src/modules/linkedlist.js](https://github.com/karldreta/LinkedList-OdinProject/blob/main/src/modules/linkedlist.js).
