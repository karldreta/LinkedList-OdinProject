# Template-Repo-01

Welcome to the Template-Repo-01! This repository serves as a starting point for future projects with Webpack, providing a streamlined setup for development.

### Getting Started

Just type in `npm install` to your project and it should install all the dependencies of our project listed in **package.json**.

Note: That this Template uses ES6 standards instead of the default CommonJS, verify the `type` in `package.json` -- it should be `  "type": "module"`.

Moreover, **Webpack** should also be in ES6 format and should be using import/export -- check out `webpack.config`.

If this doesn't work, check out **TEMPLATE.md** in this file and to know more about deployment.

- Afterwards you may rewrite this file to align with your project, have fun!
